* gamemenu->quit goes to pilot menu
* keyboard config not used by game.
* joystick calibrate, does nothing. remove it?
* joystick not implemented
* windowed/fullscreen option not implemented
* mainmenu->viewstats->outputstates asserts
* add random game option
* make gl a compile option
* remove stub.h/stub.c
* make SYS_Error work with variable args.
* remove unused source files
* cull unused functions/variables from source
* glcylindrix should draw wire tube
* for HUD and menu elements, use nearest or perhaps hqx filtering
* do something about filtering errors at edge of screen. (clamp & 1-px padding)

* move to all floating point math.

* decouple physics from frame rate.
* keep using fixed time step but interpolate / extrapolate in between rendering frames.
  This is probably the easiest way to keep existing physics feel, without a re-write.

* tcp/ip networking
* latency hiding & prediction

* valgrind pass.

* advanced rendering features glow/trails motion blur, shadows.

* Port to OpenGLES2.0 with Shaders
* Oculus Rift support
